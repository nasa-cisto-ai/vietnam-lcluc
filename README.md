# Vietnam LCLUC

Vietnam LCLUC AI/ML Repository

## Business Case

The following repository stores several experiments for the task of instance and semantic
segmentation of LCLUC in very high-resolution satellite imagery. Many of the instructions
listed below are guided towards utilizing GSFC NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS)
computing resources, particularly the PRISM GPU cluster.

A system with NVIDIA GPUs is required to run the scripts located in this repository.

- projects/cloud-mask: semantic segmentation of clouds
- projects/crop-mapping: multi-class segmentation of land cover classes
